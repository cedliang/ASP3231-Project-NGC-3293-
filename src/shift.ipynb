    "Now that our science images have been processed according to the procedure described in the opening chapters of Rieke, we must process the images further to remove problematic systemic issues in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of our images were taken in imperfect conditions without the usage of the auto-tracker. As such, there is noticeable movement of the open cluster in our images, and we must computationally correct for these imperfections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it first makes sense to get a statistical overview of the images and use some common sense to discard the ones that are clearly unfit for use. There was intermittent cloud cover on the night of our observations, and as such a reasonable portion (30-40%) of the images were taken such that the background was significantly elevated due to the reflection of terrestrial light - in some cases up to 20,000 counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it makes sense for us to first analyse our data and determine which images to simply discard.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a human element to this - it is more difficult for computational methods to discard qualitatively poor images that can impact our results, such as images with poor focus or streaking. Indeed, we noticed on the night of observation that some images had trails. With the quantity of data that we have, it makes more sense to discard these manually.\n"
